# complex_calculator
This is a complex number calculator.
It has six variables (A-F) that are initialized to 0 + 0i. 
there are several built in commands to use. 

read_comp(complex *c1, double real, double img)
print_comp(complex *c1)
add_comp(complex *c1, complex *c2)
sub_comp(complex *c1, complex *c2)
mult_comp_real(complex *c1, double real)
mult_comp_img(complex *c1, double img)
mult_comp_comp(complex *c1, complex *c2)
abs_comp(complex *c1)

to update a varaible value, use the read_comp function with one of the given variables and the values you'd like.
enjoy :)
